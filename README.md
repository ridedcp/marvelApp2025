## ðŸ§± Architecture

The project follows clean architecture principles, split into the following layers:

- **UI (UIKit + SwiftUI):** View controllers and reusable components.
- **Presenter:** Presentation logic, fully decoupled from UI.
- **Use Cases:** Application-specific business logic.
- **Repository:** Abstraction over the data source layer.
- **Data Source:** Responsible for accessing external APIs.
- **APIClient:** Low-level HTTP request abstraction.
- **Models:** Clean, decodable data structures.
